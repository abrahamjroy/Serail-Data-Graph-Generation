# Serial-Data-Graph-Generation
Another useless teensy program to create a web graph using SmoothieCharts to display the Arduino/Teensy Serial Data

This Grand champs program deals with the issue of my gloated sense of ego,and was made to satisfy another's lack of cohones

This program is used to display the serial data that is transferred to a CSV file using a Python script, which is then passed onto an HTML file that uploads this data and Graphs it using SmoothieCharts, and did i forget to mention, this also displays the location to enable you to never lose sight of your worthless board

for the .ino code to run properly, necessary DHT unified sensor and Adafruit_sensor libraries have to be installed

everything else is here for your shitless disposal you SOB's
